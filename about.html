            <p>
            Reading books is one of my hobbies and something I usually like doing. 
            League of Legends used to be a lot of fun for me, but I don't think it is now. However, 
            it doesn't alter the fact that I continue to play video games. 
            Genshin Impact is the game I'm playing at the moment. I'm learning web development right now to get better and get ready for my future Job.
             Even though I'm single, I'm sure to find a girlfriend in the future. Additionally, 
             I want to demonstrate that not all programmers should work alone.
